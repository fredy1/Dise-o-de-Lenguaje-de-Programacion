<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="flex_t.htm#TOC13">End-of-file rules</A></H2>

<P>
The special rule "&#60;&#60;EOF&#62;&#62;" indicates actions which are to
be taken when an end-of-file is encountered and yywrap()
returns non-zero (i.e., indicates no further files to
process).  The action must finish by doing one of four
things:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

assigning <CODE>yyin</CODE> to a new input file (in previous
versions of flex, after doing the assignment you
had to call the special action <CODE>YY_NEW_FILE</CODE>; this is
no longer necessary);

<LI>

executing a <CODE>return</CODE> statement;

<LI>

executing the special <SAMP>`yyterminate()'</SAMP> action;

<LI>

or, switching to a new buffer using
<SAMP>`yy_switch_to_buffer()'</SAMP> as shown in the example
above.
</UL>

<P>
&#60;&#60;EOF&#62;&#62; rules may not be used with other patterns; they
may only be qualified with a list of start conditions.  If
an unqualified &#60;&#60;EOF&#62;&#62; rule is given, it applies to <EM>all</EM>
start conditions which do not already have &#60;&#60;EOF&#62;&#62;
actions.  To specify an &#60;&#60;EOF&#62;&#62; rule for only the initial
start condition, use

</P>

<PRE>
&#60;INITIAL&#62;&#60;&#60;EOF&#62;&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
These rules are useful for catching things like unclosed
comments.  An example:

</P>

<PRE>
%x quote
%%

...other rules for dealing with quotes...

&#60;quote&#62;&#60;&#60;EOF&#62;&#62;   {
         error( "unterminated quote" );
         yyterminate();
         }
&#60;&#60;EOF&#62;&#62;  {
         if ( *++filelist )
             yyin = fopen( *filelist, "r" );
         else
            yyterminate();
         }
</PRE>
